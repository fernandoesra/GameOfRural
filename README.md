# GameOfRural
# *Mini game project on java about the life on a rural village*

### Resume
Small project in Java as a first-year final project for the "DAM 1" module of my higher grade. The goal is to create an interactive town with different professions and actions. Each character has a profession and can interact in a specific way with the map and other characters.

The player can control any of the characters and move with them, perform actions, and view their status. Or you can generate random turns and have the characters move and interact on their own.

The aim of the project is not to create a complex game, but a functional one. It is intended to learn to handle the different aspects of Java as well as the creation of interfaces.
